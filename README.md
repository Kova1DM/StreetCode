### Setup
  1. Change connection string  
   (Go to **appsettings.json** and write your local database connection string)
  2. Create local database  
   (Run project and make sure that database was created filled with data)


### How to run local 
 Run the Streetcode project than open your browser and enter https://localhost:5001/swagger/index.html url. If you had this page already opened, just reload it.

### How to connect to db locally
1. launch SQL Server management Studio
2. In the pop-up window:
    - enter **"localhost"** as the server name;
    - select **"windows authentication"** as authentication mechanism;
3. After the connection has been established, right-click on the server (the first line with the icon), on the left-hand side of the UI
4. In the the appeared window find and click on **"properties"**
5. In the properties section, select **"security"** page
6. Make sure that **"Server authentication"** radio-button is set to **"SQL Server and Windows Authentication mode"**
7. Click "Ok"
8. Then again, on the left-hand side of the UI find folder entitled **"Security"**, and expand it
9. In unrolled list of options find folder "Logins", and expand it
10. At this point, you should have **"sa"** as the last option.
    If for some reason you do not see it, please refer to https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35753254/why-login-without-rights-can-see-sa-login
11. Right-click on the "sa" item, select "properties"
12. Change password to the default system one - **"Admin@1234"**. Don't forget to confirm it afterwards
13. On the left-hand side select **"Status"** page, and set **"Login"** radio-button to **"Enabled"**
14. Click "Ok"

Now you can connect to your localhost instance with login (sa) and password (Admin@1234)!

**_NOTE:_** Here's the full walkthrough: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANFnDqe4JBk&t=211s.


### How to run Docker

1. In the **"build"** project, find the **"Targets"** folder
2. In the appeared list of classes, find and click on **"SetupPublicBuild.cs"**
3. Open the command prompt/PowerShell/linux terminal, go inside of **"/Streetcode"** directory, and start the **"SetupDocker"** Target.
```
cd ./Streetcode
nuke SetupDocker
```
After waiting for target completion, you should find that the image and running containers for back-end, front-end, db and redis have been successfully created.

**_NOTE:_**  If order to delete newly created images/containers/volumes, you can utilize the **"CleanDocker"** Target.
```
cd ./Streetcode
nuke CleanDocker
```
That will delete all unnecessary docker-atoms for you.
